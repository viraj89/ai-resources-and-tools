## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blogs-and-news.md    # Main output file with aggregated news (updated daily)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ master_resources.csv  # Comprehensive list of AI tools, apps, and resources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ script/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ update_blogs_and_news.py  # Main script for news aggregation

    â””â”€â”€ workflows/
        â””â”€â”€ daily_update.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow for automation
```

## How It Works

1. The script runs daily at 7 AM IST
2. Fetches news from Google News RSS feeds using multiple AI-related keywords
3. Processes and deduplicates the news items
4. Prioritizes important updates using severity keywords
5. Formats the content with proper markdown structure
6. Updates the `blogs-and-news.md` file with the latest news
7. Maintains a growing, curated `master_resources.csv` file with AI tools and resources

## Master Resources CSV

The `tools/resources/master_resources.csv` file is a comprehensive, manually curated list of AI tools, apps, and resources. It contains the following columns:

| Sr. No. | Tool Name | Category | URL | What it does | Free/Paid |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----|--------------|-----------|

You can add new resources to this file to help the community discover and track the evolving AI ecosystem.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Run the script manually (optional):
   ```bash
   python tools/script/update_blogs_and_news.py
   ```

## Automation

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run the script daily at 7 AM IST. The workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/daily_update.yml`.

## Output Format

The script generates a markdown file with the following structure:
- Daily sections with timestamps
- Numbered news items
- Shortened URLs for better readability
- Clear source citations
- Horizontal rules between days for better organization

The resources CSV is a separate, growing file for AI tools and resources.
