   - 10-week timeline with clear milestones

### 📋 Requirements Analysis Complete
We've identified and documented the four main areas for improvement:

1. **🔄 News and Articles Section Revamp**
   - Current Issue: Outdated articles instead of 24h fresh content
   - Solution: Enhanced RSS parsing, alternative sources, freshness scoring

2. **🛠️ Tools and Apps Section Overhaul**
   - Current Issue: Google RSS unreliable, limited quality filtering
   - Solution: Product Hunt API, Hacker News API, quality ranking

3. **🧠 Research & AI Breakthroughs (New Section)**
   - New Feature: Automated research paper discovery
   - Solution: arXiv API, Papers With Code, research analysis

4. **🔧 Tech Stack Revamp Considerations**
   - Analysis: Current Python + Next.js stack assessment
   - Strategy: Enhanced backend with Django/Flask, keep Next.js frontend
